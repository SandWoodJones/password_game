# The password game
An implementation of [neal's password game](https://neal.fun/password-game/) in Rust with a focus on accuracy.

A password valid in this implementation **should** also be valid in the regular game (given the same random factors).

This project includes:
* A tiny chess engine subpackage for calculating best possible chess move.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This program requires a UTF-8 capable terminal.
